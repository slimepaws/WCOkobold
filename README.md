# WatchCartoonsOnline.tv Kobold
Little webcrawler friend to retrieve all episodes from a series, Pulling from [WCO](https://www.wcostream.tv/) URLs.
I like to archive a lot of media these days; But due to streaming just nixing really important things to me. 
Doing the same monotonous task of download -> rename -> archive task was just getting tedious. Heres a free kobold to do the work for you.
